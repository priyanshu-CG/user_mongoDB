JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is widely used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, as well as for storing and representing structured data. Here are some reasons why JSON data is commonly used:

1. **Data Interchange Format**: JSON provides a standardized format for structuring and representing data. It allows data to be easily serialized and deserialized, making it ideal for transferring data between different systems and programming languages.

2. **Language-agnostic**: JSON is a language-agnostic format, which means it can be used with any programming language that supports JSON parsing and serialization. This makes it a versatile choice for data exchange in various applications and environments.

3. **Human-readable and Lightweight**: JSON data is human-readable, making it easy to understand and debug. It uses a simple syntax consisting of key-value pairs, arrays, and nested structures. Additionally, JSON is a lightweight format, resulting in smaller data payloads and faster data transmission over networks.

4. **Support for Complex Data Structures**: JSON supports various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. It can represent complex data structures and hierarchies, making it suitable for representing structured data such as configuration settings, user profiles, and application data.

5. **Compatibility with Web APIs**: JSON is widely used in web development, particularly in communication with web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Many web APIs return JSON-formatted data as a response, allowing web applications to consume and process the data easily.

6. **Easy Integration with JavaScript**: Since JSON is a subset of JavaScript syntax, it can be directly parsed and manipulated using JavaScript code. JavaScript provides built-in functions (`JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`) for parsing JSON strings into JavaScript objects and converting JavaScript objects into JSON strings, respectively.

Overall, JSON provides a flexible and efficient way to represent, exchange, and store structured data, making it a popular choice in modern web development and data-centric applications.






 Application is called digital board book. 
 use to log all the faults or any issues about when train is under commercial service or maintenance.
 version- React native 7.0.1 version with salesforces. target only tablet and iPad.
 login page is created by salesforce.
we can select the train that are under maintaince and commercial
USCS01 code for asset
multiple role- mainly for train they use train manager he only manage the under commercial assets  and maintainer 
can select upto 4 assets
using smart store  for storing the offline data.
if the api fail once then its trying 2-3 time and it will show pop-up
in the homepage we have all the event that has been generated 
we can able to select the event according to whole train or by carriage
we can create the event by clicking the train or specific carriage

tagIn - train manager onbord the train we assign the tag in and ....... not understand properly
